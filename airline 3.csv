@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
@united rude rude
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united 6533 ORD to DCA
"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
